# ESP32-and-Blockchain

This project allows you to connect to a blockchain contract and call function to control devices,motors... etc.

## Getting Started

ESP/arduino code can be reorganize based on contract, wallet and wi-fi details to run.

### Prerequisites

Blockchain contract, wallet address, infura details should be prepared before running it.

PS: Contract should be in ETH blockchain. Other networks may not give correct results.

### Sample Tests

ESP32 code is just for checking contract details so that is why web3 website can be usefull to change contract parameters to see ESP32 controlling.

## ESP32 libraries

  - WiFi.h
  - ArduinoJson.h
  - ESP32Servo.h
  - Contract.h
  - Web3.h
